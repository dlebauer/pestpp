#PEST++
Object Oriented Inverse Modeling Software
<br><br><br>
##Overview
PEST++ can be compiled for PC, MAC, or Linux and has several run managers to support parallelization.  PEST++ implements "on-the-fly" subspace reparameterization, effectively reproducing the SVD-Assist methodology of PEST without any user intervention.  The user simply specifies how frequently a base Jacobian should be recalculated.  

Also included in this project are global sensitivity analysis codes that implement the method of Morris and the method of Sobol.  Both of these codes include a parallel run manager as well.

##Recent Updates
<b>Update 10/1/2014</b>: recent stable versions of PEST++ implement dynamic regularization, full restart capabilities, additional options for formulating the normal equations, and an iterative SVD algorithm for very-large problems.  Additionally the YAMR run manager has been improved to use threaded workers so that the master can more easily load balance.

##Compiling
The master branch includes a Visual Studio 2013 project, as well as a Makefile.

##Testing
The benchmarks/ folder contain several test problems of varying problem size which are used to evaluate the performance of various aspects of the PEST++ algorithm and implementation.  

##Dependencies
Much work has been done to avoid additional external dependencies in PEST++.  As currently designed, the project is fully self-contained and statically linked.
